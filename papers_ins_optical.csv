Neutron Star,GW170817: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Neutron Star Inspiral,"On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per $8.0\times10^4$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 $M_\odot$, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 $M_\odot$, with the total mass of the system $2.74^{+0.04}_{-0.01}\,M_\odot$. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg$^2$ (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-14}$ Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.","the signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per $8.0times104$ years . the source was localized within",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a69a52c39da2b28ab4b0c63f88f025ee4d64689d
Neutron Star,Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger,"On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ∼ 1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 − 8 + 8 Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M ⊙ . An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at ∼ 40 Mpc ) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ∼10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient’s position ∼ 9 and ∼ 16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.",on 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves . the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9259e6979f0851e181af209e5dec65972bab71b4
Neutron Star,"Observation of Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a 2.5–4.5 M
 ⊙ Compact Object and a Neutron Star","
 We report the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses 2.5–4.5 M
 ⊙ and 1.2–2.0 M
 ⊙ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston observatory. The primary component of the source has a mass less than 5 M
 ⊙ at 99% credibility. We cannot definitively determine from gravitational-wave data alone whether either component of the source is a neutron star or a black hole. However, given existing estimates of the maximum neutron star mass, we find the most probable interpretation of the source to be the coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole that has a mass between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes observed in the Galaxy. We provisionally estimate a merger rate density of

 for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star–black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources may make up the majority of neutron star–black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star–black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.",the gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA detector network on 2023 may 29 . the primary component of the source has a mass less than 5 M ,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5abde4676762f96f27bc8be109e40ebdc752290c

Neutron Star,Observation of Gravitational Waves from Two Neutron Star–Black Hole Coalescences,"We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries. The two events are named GW200105_162426 and GW200115_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo and the second by all three LIGO–Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses 8.9−1.5+1.2 and 1.9−0.2+0.3M⊙ , whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses 5.7−2.1+1.8 and 1.5−0.3+0.7M⊙ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The probability that the secondary’s mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%–96% and 87%–98%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are 280−110+110 and 300−100+150Mpc , respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88% probability. We are unable to constrain the spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer an NSBH merger rate density of 45−33+75Gpc−3yr−1 when assuming that GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population or 130−69+112Gpc−3yr−1 under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.",the two events are named GW200105_162426 and GW200115_042309 . they have properties consistent with neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries . the probability that the secondary’s mass is below the maximal mass of a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2ed496970331053f26b341e7bfeda434f45d8fe
Optical Observation,Optical observation of single spins in silicon,"The global quantum internet will require long-lived, telecommunications-band photon–matter interfaces manufactured at scale1. Preliminary quantum networks based on photon–matter interfaces that meet a subset of these demands are encouraging efforts to identify new high-performance alternatives2. Silicon is an ideal host for commercial-scale solid-state quantum technologies. It is already an advanced platform within the global integrated photonics and microelectronics industries, as well as host to record-setting long-lived spin qubits3. Despite the overwhelming potential of the silicon quantum platform, the optical detection of individually addressable photon–spin interfaces in silicon has remained elusive. In this work, we integrate individually addressable ‘T centre’ photon–spin qubits in silicon photonic structures and characterize their spin-dependent telecommunications-band optical transitions. These results unlock immediate opportunities to construct silicon-integrated, telecommunications-band quantum information networks. Individually addressable ‘T centre’ photon-spin qubits are integrated in silicon photonic structures and their spin-dependent telecommunications-band optical transitions characterized, creating opportunities to construct silicon-integrated, telecommunications-band quantum information networks.","the global quantum internet will require long-lived, telecommunications-band photon–matter interfaces manufactured at scale . silicon is already an advanced platform within the global integrated photonics and microelectronics industries .",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c2d2273062bd2800be2b02b34b9e69ab234b052
Optical Observation,Optical observation of needles in upward lightning flashes,"Why lightning sometimes has multiple discharges to ground is an unanswered question. Recently, the observation of small plasma structures on positive leaders re-ignited the search. These small plasma structures were observed as pulsing radio sources along the positive leader length and were named “needles”. Needles may be the missing link in explaining why lightning flickers with multiple discharges, but this requires further confirmation. In this work we present the first optical observations of these intriguing plasma structures. Our high-speed videos show needles blinking in slow motion in a sequential mode. We show that they are formed at unsuccessful leader branches, are as bright as the lightning leaders, and report several other optical characteristics.",the observation of small plasma structures on positive leaders re-ignited the search . needles may be missing link in explaining why lightning flickers with multiple discharges . high-speed videos show needles blinking in slow motion in sequential mode .,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d2ed3a317939fd6b86f98f07d08d4c39aa03b93
Optical Observation,Effect of Defects on Diffusion Behaviors of Lithium-Ion Battery Electrodes: In Situ Optical Observation and Simulation.,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy efficiency are urgently needed in various fields. For the LIBs electrodes, defects would be generated during the manufacturing processes and mechanical degradation and significantly impact the stability and performance of the LIBs. However, the effects of electrode defects on the electrochemical processes are still not clear. Herein, an in situ optical observation system is developed for monitoring the Li diffusion around the preintroduced defects in the commercial graphite electrodes. The experiments show that the gas-filled defects vertical to the direction of the Li diffusion would obviously decelerate the Li diffusion, whereas the electrolyte-filled defects parallel to the direction of the Li diffusion would accelerate the Li diffusion. In addition, finite element analysis (FEA) suggests, consistent with the experiments, a nonuniform distribution of local Li concentration around the defect. The equivalent diffusivity obtained by the FEA is also dependent on the configuration of the defects. The diffusivities of the electrolyte-filled parallel defect and gas-filled vertical defect are 12.6 and 11.0%, respectively. For the gas-filled defects, the size-effect calculation manifests that the equivalent diffusivity would decrease with the enlarged defect size, and the shape of the defects would substantially impact the decrease rate. The results directly reveal the mechanisms of the defect-induced diffusion behavior change in the electrodes by the new equivalent two-dimensional experiments, and the equivalent diffusivity would be useful for optimizing the electrode designs in LIBs.",the effects of electrode defects on the electrochemical processes are still not clear . an in situ optical observation system is developed for monitoring the Li diffusion . the results directly reveal the mechanisms of the defect-induced diffusion behavior change .,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abbf8910e714a5bda0d3b3b4c7b20f0590fec8eb
Optical Observation,Real time optical observation and control of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide synthesis.,"Understanding the mechanisms involved in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) synthesis of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) requires precise control of numerous growth parameters. All the proposed mechanisms and their relationship with the growth conditions are inferred from characterising intermediate formations obtained by stopping the growth blindly. To fully understand the reaction routes that lead to the monolayer formation, real time observation and control of the growth are needed. Here, we demonstrate how a custom-made CVD chamber that allows real time optical monitoring can be employed to study the reaction routes that are critical to the production of the desired layered thin crystals in salt assisted TMDC synthesis. Our real time observations reveal the reaction between the salt and the metallic precursor to form intermediate compounds which lead to the layered crystal formation. We identified that both the vapour-solid-solid and vapour-liquid-solid growth routes are in an interplay. Furthermore, we demonstrate the role H2 plays in the salt-assisted WSe2 synthesis. Finally, we observed the synthesis of the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures optically, and elucidated the conditions required for both lateral and vertical heterostructure syntheses.",a custom-made chamber that allows real time optical monitoring can be employed to study the reaction routes that are critical to the production of the desired layered thin crystals . real time observations reveal the reaction between the salt and the metallic precursor .,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/398f5c5a2a6bbc2df21df7458c9990e2a6567645
Optical Observation,Optical observation of single layer graphene on silicon nitride substrate,"Optical observation of graphene on substrates is an important aspect of graphene research. However, while graphene visibility on SiO2/Si substrates has already been thoroughly investigated, that on Si3N4/Si substrates, which excludes background oxygen, requires further investigation. Here, we present theoretical and experimental results of graphene visibility on Si3N4/Si substrates. On these substrates, the graphene contrast that diverges and changes sign over narrow ranges, which makes it more difficult to observe graphene on them, was predicted and experimentally verified. Under appropriate conditions, it was possible to observe single layer graphene on these substrates, as demonstrated by our experimentally observed results. Our findings will be useful for enabling the use of Si3N4/Si substrates in characterizing functionalized graphenes.","graphene visibility on Si3N4/Si substrates, which excludes background oxygen, requires further investigation . a single layer of graphenite was able to be observed on these substrates under appropriate conditions .",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/228f63ad4151ed5b582d0dd31644132cca10d0d7
